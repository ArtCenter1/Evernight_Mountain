Based on the content of the PDF, here is a structural analysis of the story "永夜山" (Evernight Mountain).

### 1. Structure Type Identified
The story primarily follows a **non-linear, mystery-thriller structure** with heavy use of flashbacks, unreliable narration, and a final twist that reframes the entire narrative. It incorporates elements of psychological horror and a whodunit.

### 2. Key Plot Points Mapped
*   **Opening:** The story begins *in medias res* with the protagonist, Zhang Jiayu (張家育), waking up in a hospital as the sole survivor of a disastrous mountain expedition. This immediately establishes the central mystery.
*   **Inciting Incident:** The police play a recording from a tape recorder found on Jiayu, which begins to narrate the events that led to the tragedy. This recording serves as the primary vehicle for the story's exposition.
*   **Plot Point 1 (The Twist Setup):** The narrative unfolds through the recording, detailing how seven climbers get trapped in a cave on Evernight Mountain during a snowstorm. The discovery of an old journal and ancient murals introduces a supernatural or curse element, locking the characters into the central conflict.
*   **Midpoint (The Reversal):** The first death occurs (Lü Dongyi / 呂冬頤), and Jiayu's knife is found by the body, making him a suspect. The group decides to confess their secrets, which shifts the dynamic from an external (survival) conflict to an internal one, driven by paranoia and suspicion.
*   **Plot Point 2 (Escalation to Maximum Stakes):** A monster appears, leading to the deaths of Sun Bo'an (孫博安) and his daughter. The remaining survivors escape to a mountain cabin, where the conflict escalates to violence. Guns are drawn, secrets of infidelity are revealed, and the group implodes, leading to a cascade of murders.
*   **Climax:** The recording's climax reveals Jiayu as the orchestrator of all the deaths, using his knowledge of electronics to cause malfunctions and murdering everyone one by one.
*   **Resolution (The TRUE Twist):** The psychiatrist, Shao Huiqi (邵惠琪), doesn't believe the official story. She plays the final part of the recording for the person in the hospital bed, revealing he is not the autistic Jiayu, but his twin brother, Zhang Jiaxiang (張家翔). The recording was a false narrative created by the real Jiayu to protect his murderous brother. Jiaxiang, consumed by jealousy and rage, was the true killer. The real Jiayu switched their identities and disappeared into the mountains. The story ends with the mystery unresolved, the brothers' fates unknown, and the supernatural elements of the mountain left ambiguous.

### 3. Pacing Analysis
*   **Tension:** The pacing is relentless, starting with an immediate mystery and using the tape recording as a framing device to build suspense.
*   **Breather Moments:** There are very few "breather" moments. The narrative is a constant escalation of paranoia, secrets, and violence.
*   **Action/Reflection Balance:** The story heavily favors action and plot twists over deep character reflection, which is appropriate for a thriller. The final reveal serves as the ultimate "reflection," forcing the reader to re-evaluate everything they've just learned.

### 4. Setup & Payoff Evaluation
*   **Setup:** The twin brothers' childhood game of "hide-and-seek."
    *   **Payoff:** This becomes the final, chilling word on the recording—a secret signal between the brothers that exposes the identity swap and the entire preceding narrative as a lie.
*   **Setup:** Jiayu's autism and his reliance on a voice recorder.
    *   **Payoff:** This is expertly used as a misdirection. We trust the recording because we believe it's the unfiltered thoughts of someone who cannot lie, making the final reveal that it's a *constructed* lie all the more impactful.
*   **Setup:** The 1969 journal and the mysterious hiker, Du Zhongyu (杜仲宇).
    *   **Payoff:** It's revealed that Du Zhongyu was a member of the lost 1969 expedition, adding a layer of supernatural mystery that is intentionally left unresolved, enhancing the mountain's mystique.

### 5. Subplot Integration
*   **Main Plot:** Who killed the climbers on Evernight Mountain?
*   **Subplot 1:** The affair between Ann (程禹凡) and Hans (江書桓). This acts as a catalyst for the violence in the mountain cabin and fuels Jiaxiang's rage.
*   **Subplot 2:** The history of abuse between Sun Bo'an and his daughter. This adds to the dark, oppressive atmosphere and provides a red herring for their deaths.
*   **Subplot 3:** The lifelong jealousy and resentment of Jiaxiang towards his brother, Jiayu. This is the core emotional driver of the story, initially hidden but ultimately revealed as the central motivation for the entire tragedy.

### 6. Final Report Summary
"永夜山" is a tightly constructed psychological thriller that uses a non-linear structure and an unreliable narrator to great effect. Its primary strength is the masterful use of setup and payoff, particularly the "hide-and-seek" motif and the voice recorder, which builds to a powerful and satisfying twist ending. The pacing is swift and suspenseful, and all subplots effectively serve to misdirect the audience and escalate the central conflict. The ambiguous, supernatural elements surrounding the mountain itself add a unique flavor to the narrative.
