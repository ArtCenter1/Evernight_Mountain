# 永夜山
導演賴俊羽

兩個雙胞胎兄弟躲在櫃子裡玩捉迷藏,悄悄地說著話:
「那,要遵守約定喔!」
「當然啊。」
「你會來找我嗎?」
「會,一定會的。」
「我會一直等你,等你來找我。」

張家育從夢中驚醒,發現自己在病房內手上插滿了針孔,頭上纏著繃帶。他瞇著眼,看著
電視上的新聞報導:七名登山客擅自闖入未開放的山區,失蹤整整兩天,當中有20年經驗
的登山嚮導帶隊,卻在海拔不到500公尺處受困,紮營於洞穴中,失蹤後兩天才發出求救
訊號。搜救隊上山救援,赫然發現五人已經遇難,一人下落不明。七人中僅有一人倖存,
目前在病房觀察中,尚未清醒。

「張家育,你終於醒過來了!」警方逼問山上究竟發生了什麼事,他一臉茫然。精神科醫
師邵惠琪介入,告知病患張家育自小就有自閉症,無法正常地與外界溝通,僅能把想說的
話錄在錄音筆裡。警方找出先前從張家育身上搜得的錄音筆,按下了播放鍵……………。

張家育參加了登山社,他們計畫攀登東部傳說中的秘境「永夜山」,隊員包括:
張家育的雙胞胎哥哥保險業務員張家翔,與其女友電商客服程禹凡;
運動品店老闆江書桓,與其妻子麗陽集團千金呂冬頤;
考古學家並具有20年經驗登山嚮導孫博安,與其女兒孫筱晴;
以及電子廠作業員,張家育。

七人前往東部永夜山,登山途中嚮導女兒孫筱晴不慎差點跌倒,張家育好意攙扶,卻被孫
筱晴過度反應將張家育推開。七人走到一半,天氣大變竟下起雪來,眾人的指南針與電子
設備盡數失靈,迷失方向,眾人就近前往一處洞穴避難。

洞穴中出現一人,他自稱名叫杜仲宇,專做山林研究,也因為下雪所以到了洞穴暫避。嚮
導孫博安評估只要等今晚雪停,第二天就可以下山了。在大家分頭準備晚餐時,張家育發
現洞穴裡有一本日誌,落款時間為1969年,一組登山客欲攻頂永夜山,同樣因大雪困在洞
穴裡,被困在永遠的黑暗中,組員一個個死去,日誌作者開始聽到洞穴深處的聲音。日誌
的最後幾頁寫了滿滿的「我不想死」。

夜晚,孫筱晴向張家育為先前兩人接觸時的過度反應致歉,表示自己不習慣被觸碰。而哥
哥張家翔的女友程禹凡
趁張家育獨處時,竟抱住了張家育示好,竟突然被張家翔撞見,張家育解釋不清,以為只
是夢。

隔了一夜,天還未亮,眾人手錶與各類顯示時間的儀器全都停留在23:59。眾人決定分頭
探索洞穴是否有其他出口,卻發現洞穴壁上有原始壁畫與古文,考古學家孫博安解讀壁畫
是關於山神傳說,古文含義是:「揭開所有秘密,黎明方能到來」。眾人發現呂冬頤遲遲
未歸,搜尋發現呂冬頤遭割喉身亡,屍體旁沾血的竟是張家育的小刀!

眾人想起洞穴上的古文,不禁毛骨悚然,孫博安懷疑眾人被困在詛咒裡,
七人在求生意志的驅使下,於是決定輪流說出自己的秘密。輪到程禹凡
時,她不願意揭露自己的秘密,卻被懷疑是兇手。張家育為了幫她解圍,說出了自己暗戀
程禹凡並恨著哥哥張家翔搶走自己喜歡的女孩。

程禹凡私下向張家育道謝,張家育說自己並不恨張家翔,兩人從小感情很好,
經常玩捉迷藏:而從張家翔就時常要他撒謊騙父母,以便讓張家翔出去玩,因為他們父母
相信自閉症的張家育不會說謊,為了掩護張家翔,張家育練習對著錄音機說謊,每當張家
翔講出暗號「捉迷藏」,張家育就對著錄音筆說謊。但不知什麼時候開始,張家翔對自己
的態度卻越來越冷淡,程禹凡摟著張家育安慰。

此時,洞穴深處傳出怪物吼叫聲,一隻與壁畫相似的怪物竄出!眾人逃離洞穴,孫博安遭
怪物撲倒,沒想到孫筱晴反而竟然拿起石頭將孫博安砸死,而自己也被怪物咬死。

張家育、張家翔和程禹
凡、江書桓、杜仲宇逃到廢棄的山屋。江書桓指責杜仲宇搞鬼,「你到底是誰?你出現後
一切都出問題了!」江書桓邊說邊身上找東西。

「你在找這個嗎?」杜仲宇從懷裡掏出了一把槍「你在找這個吧?」在槍口逼問下,江書
桓坦承本來想藉這次登山機會殺了一直以來都瞧不起他的太太呂冬頤,並脅迫呂冬頤跳崖
自殺,怎知她卻先遭人割喉殺害。

杜仲宇轉問程禹
凡,「那妳有什麼秘密?」張家翔為了保護女友跟杜仲宇扭打,江書桓見狀開槍,想趁機意
外走火射殺了杜仲宇。

此時,張家翔看到江書桓身上掉落了一疊照片,竟是程禹凡
和江書桓的偷情照!「你這對狗男女!」張家翔開槍擊斃江書桓,但江書桓中槍的同時,也
威脅我要公佈…」

「你搶了我的女人,又殺了你老婆,你這畜生!」江書桓說出這話,張家翔開槍上,兩人
扭打張家翔失足墜崖。程禹凡
撿起槍追上,見男友墜崖,情緒失控開槍擊中江書桓,江書桓拼著最後的力氣,將程禹凡
掐死,自己也隨之死去。

目睹一切的張家育受到嚴重驚嚇,他口述錄下了所見的經過,最後錄下:「......現在,只
剩下我的秘密了。其實我一點都不恨你,我一直在等你......一直在等你。等你有一天來找
我,再跟我玩一次捉迷藏...。」錄音嘎然而止。

回到現實,警方聽完錄音後懷疑。首先,孫博安與孫筱晴父女是失溫而死,而非被石頭砸
死或被咬死,且附近都沒有杜仲宇的屍體與蹤跡。

警方推測張家育計畫一切,怪物和杜仲宇都是張家育的謊言,真相是張家育殺了所有人。利
用自己電子專業干擾破壞設備,再將壞的指南針提供給孫博安與孫筱晴父女,指引他們前

往錯的方向害他們失溫而死。接著殺害呂冬頤,將張家翔推落山崖,開槍打死了江書桓,
最後將程禹凡掐死。而錄音最後提到的「捉迷D藏」,就是代表張家育說謊!

精神科醫師邵惠琪不相信警方的說法,暗地偷走錄音筆找張家育。放出錄音筆的內容想喚
醒張家育,當他聽最後那段「捉迷藏」的錄音時,
小張家育的人不是張家育,是張家翔!

張家翔挾持邵惠琪開車前往永夜山。路上張家翔提起從小因為張家育患有自閉症,父母只
關注張家育,張家翔一直被忽略,甚至被交代要照顧好弟弟的壓力,他去哪裡都要帶著弟
弟。就在登山社裡遇見了程禹凡,他們兄弟兩人也都愛上了程禹凡。

張家翔說錄音筆的前半部都是真的,而後半部的真相是:洞穴中眾人輪流說出秘密時,程
禹凡的態度引起張家翔懷疑;程禹凡
摟著安慰張家育被張家翔看見,引發他的嫉妒,挑起了他一直以來對張家育的不滿。山屋
裡槍枝走火誤殺了杜仲宇。而看見程禹凡
與江書桓偷情的照片後,張家翔完全失去理智,一怒之下槍殺了江書桓。在張家翔的槍口
逼迫下,程禹凡坦承是她殺了呂冬頤,為了隱瞞自己與江書桓的不倫,張家翔殺紅了眼將
程禹凡
掐死。張家翔失去理智看向弟弟嘴裡喃喃唸著:「要是沒有你,這一切都不會發生....。
」張家翔想連張家育也殺掉,兩人扭打卻被張家育拿石頭敲昏....。而張家翔醒來發現自
己在醫院,被警方誤認為是張家育,最後的錄音是張家育留給張家翔的暗號....。張家育
其實不恨他,而是希望可以成為一直保護他的哥哥。張家育將張家翔打昏後,將兩人的衣
服證件對調後,「現在開始,你就是我,我就是你了。我當了哥哥,要好好保護弟弟。」
張家育修好了電子設備,發出求救訊號後,往山林的深處走去...。

張家翔駕車到永夜山釋放了邵惠琪,獨自往山上走去。警方趕到後開始大規模搜山,卻怎
麼也找不到兩兄弟的行蹤。警方後續的調查發現:孫筱晴原來常年受到父親孫博安的性侵
。那本1969年的日誌裡,赫然發現杜仲宇是遇難的登山隊的其中一員,

負責調查的警方和邵惠琪說,「太玄了!這七個人還有永夜山,都成了一個謎團。」精神
科醫師邵惠琪望著遠處的山,喃喃地說。「或許,兄弟兩人說出自己的秘密後,得到了永
夜山的應允,玩起了只屬於他們的捉迷藏吧。」

深山裡,張家育靜靜躺著,微光中的張家翔搖醒了張家育,張家育喜極而泣地笑著,
鏡頭切回兩人都變成年幼的模樣,
哥哥伸手摸弟弟的頭,弟弟笑嘻嘻地跑開,哥哥頑皮地追上去,倆人在美麗的草原上追逐
...。
完

Two twin brothers hide inside a closet playing hide-and-seek, whispering to each other:
"Then, you have to keep your promise, okay?"
"Of course."
"Will you come looking for me?"
"Yes, I definitely will."
"I will always wait for you... until you come find me."

Yu jolts awake from a dream and finds himself in a hospital room, his arms covered in IV marks
and his head wrapped in bandages. Squinting at the television, he sees a news report:
"Seven climbers trespassed into a restricted mountain area and went missing for two days.
Among them was a guide with 20 years of experience, yet they were trapped at an altitude of less
than 500 meters. They took shelter in a cave and sent out a distress signal only two days after
disappearing. When the rescue team arrived, they found five dead, one missing, and only one
survivor, who remains unconscious in the hospital under observation."

" Yu! You're finally awake!" The police press him for answers about what happened on the
mountain, but he looks utterly confused. Psychiatrist Shao intervenes, explaining that Yu has had
autism since childhood and struggles to communicate. He can only express himself by recording
his thoughts on a voice recorder.

The police retrieve the recorder found on Yu and press play...
Yu had joined a mountaineering club, and they planned to ascend the legendary "Aremengan
mount" in the East. The team members included:
* Yu's twin brother, Xiang, an insurance salesman, and his girlfriend, Ann.
* Hans, the owner of a sporting goods store, and his wife, Lu, heiress of the Liyang Group.
* Sun, an archaeologist and mountaineering guide with 20 years of experience, and his
daughter, Ching.
* Yu, an electronics factory worker.

The seven of them set off to climb Aremengan mount. On the way, Ching nearly slipped and fell,
but when Yu reached out to help, she overreacted and pushed him away. As they climbed, the
weather suddenly changed, and it started snowing heavily. Their compasses and electronic
devices all failed, leaving them lost. They decided to take shelter in a nearby cave.

Inside, they encountered a man who introduced himself as Du, a forest researcher also seeking
refuge from the snow. Sun assessed the situation and assured everyone that once the snow
stopped, they could descend the mountain the next day.

While preparing dinner, Yu discovered an old journal dated 1969. It belonged to a group of
climbers who had attempted to summit Aremengan mount but were also trapped in a cave due to
heavy snow. One by one, they perished. The journal's author began hearing strange sounds from
deep within the cave. The last few pages were filled with the repeated phrase: "I don't want to
die."

That night, Ching apologized to Yu for overreacting earlier, explaining that she wasn't used to
being touched. Later, Yu dreamt that Ann hugged him, only to wake up and realize it was just a
dream—one interrupted by his brother, Xiang, witnessing the scene.

The next morning, before dawn, everyone's watches and electronic devices remained frozen at
23:59. They decided to explore the cave in search of another exit. On the cave walls, they found
ancient murals and inscriptions. Sun interpreted them, explaining that the murals depicted a
legend of the mountain god, and the text read: "Only by revealing all secrets can dawn arrive."

Soon, they noticed Lu was missing. After searching, they found her with her throat slit, and next
to her bloodied body lay Yu's knife.

Terrified, they recalled the ancient inscription. Sun suggested that they might be trapped by a
curse. Driven by their will to survive, they decided to take turns confessing their secrets. When it
was Ann's turn, she refused to speak, making her a suspect. To defend her, Yu revealed that he
had secretly loved her but resented his brother for stealing the girl he liked.

Later, Ann thanked Yu in private. He told her that he never truly hated Xiang. They were close
as children and often played hide-and-seek. Xiang would frequently make him lie to their parents
so he could sneak out, knowing that their parents believed Yu—due to his autism—would never
lie. To help his brother, Yu practiced lying by recording false statements on his recorder. Their
secret signal was the phrase "hide-and-seek." But over time, Xiang grew distant. Ann comforted
Yu as he recalled these memories.

Suddenly, a monstrous roar echoed from deep within the cave. A creature, resembling the one in
the murals, emerged! The group fled in terror. Sun was tackled by the creature, but shockingly,
his own daughter, Ching, picked up a rock and bashed his head in, killing him. The monster then
bit into her, killing her as well.

The remaining five—Yu, Xiang, Ann, Hans, and Du—escaped to an abandoned mountain cabin.
Jiang accused Du, demanding, "Who are you, really? Everything started going wrong the
moment you appeared!"

Du smirked and pulled out a gun. Under the gunpoint, Jiang admitted that he had planned to use
this trip to kill his wife, Lu, whom he despised. He intended to force her to jump off a cliff, but
someone else killed her first.

Du then turned to Ann. "What's your secret?" Before she could answer, Xiang attacked him. In
the struggle, the gun fired, accidentally killing Du.

At that moment, Xiang noticed a stack of photographs that had fallen from Jiang's pocket—
photos of Ann and Jiang having an affair. Enraged, Xiang chased Jiang, who fell off a cliff. Ann,
devastated, shot Jiang as he hung from the edge, killing him. In his dying moments, Jiang
strangled Ann, killing her as well.

A horrified Yu recorded everything he witnessed. His final words on the recorder were:
"... Now, only my secret remains. The truth is, I never hated you. I was always waiting for you ...
waiting for you to find me... to play hide-and-seek with me again."

Back in the hospital, the police questioned te truth of Yu's recording. Sun and Ching had actually
died of hypothermia, not from an attack. There was also no trace of Du. They suspected Yu
orchestrated everything. They theorized that he tampered with the electronic devices, gave Sun a
faulty compass, and led them astray, causing them to freeze to death. He then killed Lu, pushed
Xiang off the cliff, and shot Jiang before strangling Ann.

Psychiatrist Shao, however, stole the recorder and played it for Yu, hoping to reach him. But as
Yu listened to the final words "hide-and-seek," he suddenly realized—he wasn't Yu. He was
Xiang.

Xiang took Shao hostage and drove toward Aremengan mount. On the way, he reflected on their
childhood—how their parents ignored him in favor of his autistic brother, how he resented being
forced to take care of Yu, and how they both loved Ann.

He admitted that the first half of the recording was true. But the truth was, Ann had killed Lu,
and Xiang, consumed by rage, killed Ann in the end. Yu, instead of hating his brother, had
switched their identities before disappearing into the mountains.

Xiang vanished into Aremengan mount. The police searched, but the brothers were never found.

In the deep mountains, Yu lay still. A faint light shone as Xiang woke him. Tears of joy filled
Yu's eyes. They were children again, playing hide-and-seek in an endless field of green.

The End.
