## System Improvement Notes - Session 1

**File Ingestion:**
*   The `read_file` tool successfully processed the PDF, which is great.
*   However, the OCR output, while good, is not perfect and contains some errors. A more advanced OCR or a tool that can directly parse text from PDFs would be an improvement.
*   For a team of agents, it would be more efficient if they could all access the file content simultaneously, rather than having the orchestrator read it and "distribute" it. A shared context or memory space for files would be beneficial.

**Session Documentation:**
*   The user suggested documenting each brainstorming session in a separate file, with a designated scribe. This is an excellent workflow improvement.
*   A built-in "scribe" or "logger" agent role could be a valuable addition to the system.
*   The system could also provide functionality to automatically log session transcripts or summaries.

**Transcript-style Logging:**
*   The user has clarified that a detailed, transcript-style log of each agent's contribution is preferred over a summary.
*   This highlights the need for more granular and detailed logging features in the system, with the ability to capture conversations verbatim.
