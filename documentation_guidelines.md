# Project Workflow & Documentation Guidelines

## 1. Session Documentation

All creative sessions will be documented following these guidelines:

### 1.1. File Naming Convention
- Each session will have its own bilingual markdown file in the `Docs/` folder.
- The filename should be descriptive of the session's content (e.g., `character_development_session_bilingual.md`).

### 1.2. File Format
- **Scribe:** The Editor, Edward (愛德華), is the designated scribe.
- **Bilingual Content:** All content should be provided in both English (EN) and Traditional Chinese (ZH).
- **Agent Names:** All agents should be referred to by their full title and name in both languages.
- **Checkboxes:** Each agent's contribution should be preceded by a checkbox (`- [ ]`).
- **Numbered Checkboxes for Reviews:** For comprehensive sessions or expanded analyses, use numbered checkboxes (e.g., `- [ ] 1.1 EN:`) to facilitate external review and idea selection. Numbers should follow a pattern like AgentNumber.IdeaNumber (e.g., 1.1 for World Builder's first idea).
- **Navigation Links:** All child pages should include navigation links at the top and bottom:
  - Top: "Return to Home Page / 返回主頁" linking to README.md
  - Bottom right: "Next / 下一頁" linking to the next logical page in sequence
- **Download Link:** Each file should end with a markdown link to itself for easy downloading.

### 1.3. Agent Roster
- **World Builder:** Warren / 華倫
- **Plot Architect:** Arthur / 亞瑟
- **Character Psychologist:** Evelyn / 伊芙琳
- **Dialogue Specialist:** David / 大衛
- **Narrative Designer:** Nora / 諾拉
- **Genre Specialist:** Gabriel / 加百列
- **Editor:** Edward / 愛德華
- **Producer:** Marcus / 馬庫斯
- **Director:** Donnie / 唐尼

## 2. Workflow Feedback Documentation

At the end of each session, a dedicated section for workflow feedback should be added to the session transcript. This is crucial for the meta-goal of improving the BMad method and expansion packs.

Use the following template:

## 3. README.md Updates
- After each session, the main `README.md` file should be updated with a link to the new session transcript under the "Session Records" section.

## 4. Version Control
- All documentation will be managed using Git.
- The Editor is responsible for committing and pushing changes after each session.
