# Project Workflow & Documentation Guidelines

## 1. Session Documentation

All creative sessions will be documented following these guidelines:

### 1.1. File Naming Convention
- Each session will have its own bilingual markdown file in the `Docs/` folder.
- The filename should be descriptive of the session's content (e.g., `character_development_session_bilingual.md`).

- **Bilingual Content:** All content should be provided in both English (EN) and Traditional Chinese (ZH).
- **Agent Names:** All agents should be referred to by their full title and name in both languages.
- **Checkboxes:** Each agent's contribution should be preceded by a checkbox (`- [ ]`).
